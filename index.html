<h2>Course Overview and Policies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The world is growing increasingly reliant on collecting and analyzing information to help people make decisions. Because of this, the ability to communicate effectively about data is an important component of future job prospects across nearly all disciplines. In this course, students learn the foundations of information visualization and sharpen their skills in communicating using data. This course explores concepts in decision-making, human perception, color theory and storytelling as they apply to data-driven communication. This course helps students build a strong foundation in how to talk to people about data, for both aspiring data scientists and students who want to learn new ways of presenting information.</p> 

<p>No prior programming experience is required for this class.</p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
By the end of this course students will be able to:

<ul> 
  <li>Map data to appropriate visual channels</li>
  <li>Critically read a visualization</li>
  <li>Tell data stories via visualization</li>
  <li>Employ user-centered design</li>
</ul>

<h4>Topics Covered</h4>
The following topics will be covered in this class:

<ul>
  <li>Introduction to data</li>
  <li>Data-visual mapping</li>
  <li>Introduction to perception</li>
  <li>Tableau</li>
  <li>User-centered design</li>
</ul>

<h4>Topics <strong>Not</strong> Covered</h4>
The following topics will not be covered in this class:

<ul>
  <li>Introduction to coding</li>
  <li>Introduction to statistics</li>
  <li>Data wrangling</li>
  <li>Advanced visualization theory</li>
</ul>

<h4>Time Management</h4>

Smith college guidelines suggest 3 hours of work per credit per week. This is a 4 credit course, so you should expect to spend 12 hours on it per week:

<ul>
  <li>2.5 hours in class</li>
  <li>1-2 hours preparing for class</li>
  <li>7.5-8.5 hours on homework and outside study</li>
</ul>

Remember, the purpose of class time is to introduce and explore new topics. To complete assignments, you will often need to look up, learn, and practice material that extends beyond that covered during class meeting times. 

<h3>Communication Expectations</h3>

<p>All written communication regarding this course will take place via Slack (a cloud-based communcation platform that supports text, voice, and video). This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>announcements (in the #general channel)</li>
  <li>questions about the material (in the #questions channel)</li>
  <li>messages between individual students and the instructor</li>
</ul>

<p>Email is hard to search, response rate is slow, and messages are likely to get lost. Use Slack!</p>

<p>Messages sent M-F between 9am and 5pm will get a response within 24hrs. Messages sent outside of this time frame will have a slower response rate.</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook for this class.</p>

<p>If you would like textbooks to use as reference, here are some (imperfect) options:</p>
<ul>
   <li><em>Data Feminism (Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein), MIT Press, 2020</em></li>
   <li><em>Visualization Analysis and Design (Tamara Munzner), CRC Press, 2014</em></li>
   <li><em>Visual Thinking for Information Design (Colin Ware), Morgan Kaufmann, 2021</em></li>
   <li><em>Beautiful Visualization: Looking at Data Through the Eyes of Experts (Julie Steele and Noah Iliinsky), O'Reilly, 2010</em></li>
   <li><em>The Functional Art (Alberto Cairo), New Riders, 2012</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If purchasing causes financial strain please come see Ab so that we can make alternative arrangements.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>All assignments will be submitted through Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/951444" target="_blank">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/951444</a></p>
<p>Entry code: 4JBE5B</p>

<p>There are a variety of assignments in this class: Homeworks, Mid-Semester Project, Final Project, and Participation and Engagement. The purpose of this is provide as many ways as possible for students to demonstrate mastery of material.</p>

<h4>Homeworks</h4>  

<p>Homework is a chance to practice topics covered in lecture and receive feedback. See rubrics for grading guidelines. During the first half of the semester, the primary deliverables for this course will be weekly data challenges. A new dataset will be introduced during lecture, along with a set of guiding questions. Your task is to use what you know about data visualization and modeling to wrangle, explore, and ultimately report back your findings. Along the way, you'll document your analysis process, justify your visualization choices, and report any assumptions you make about the data.</p>

<h4>Mid-Semester Project</h4>  

<p>The mid-semester project is a chance for students to work together and explore the creative side of information visualization. The project will be completed in groups, and will culminate in a physical visualization to be shared with the Smith campus. Grading will consider individual contributions, group dynamics, technical details, and creativity.</p>  

<h4>Final Project</h4>

<p>Final projects present the opportunity for students to apply the visualization techniques covered in class to a topic of interest to them. This assignment will be completed in groups. Grading will look at technical details, and creativity.</p>

<h4>Participation and Engagement</h4>

<p>Participation and engagement will take into account contributions in class which demonstrate intellectual curiosity or clear understanding of a topic, comments which help others in class to learn a difficult concept, timeliness and proactive communication about class attendance, and lab submissions.</p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>
<p>All assignments are due as listed on the <a href="#schedule">Course Schedule</a>. Because our lives and learning do not always go as planned, every student will be able grant themselves extensions on homework assignments according to the instructions below.</p>

<p>Remember, we develop skills through constant practice. This course features weekly assignments, which build from one week to the next, and each assignment is designed to take a full week of work. Delaying the completion of an assignment will put you at a disadvantage going into the next one. Nevertheless, sometimes a little flexibility makes a huge difference, so students are empowered to give themselves extensions when it would aid their ability to master the material. Only extensions which precisely adhere to the guidelines below will be considered valid. Late assignments without a valid extension will receive no credit.</p>

<h4>Extension Guidelines</h4>
<p>Extensions must be requested before the work is due, and they will not be given retroactively. When working with a group, students submit a collective extension request. Work turned in under an extension will receive the lowest priority for grading, and in some cases may not be returned until the end of the semester.</p>

<h4>Requesting an Extension</h4>
<p>Prior to the original deadline for the assignment, submit a file called extension.txt on Gradescope that contains the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your name (and group members' names)</li>
  <li>Assignment number and original due date</li>
  <li>Duration of extension and new due date</li>
  <li>Review of any prior extension requests</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
  Ab Mosca and Jordan Crouser
  HW09 originally due 10/01/24
  2 day extension, now due 10/03/2024
  Previous extentions: HW02 (1 day), HW7 (2 days)
</pre>

<p>Be sure that you do not submit any other files with your extension request. You can bring your code in progress to office or TA hours if you need. Do not turn in work that you do not want to be graded.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished, and before your new deadline expires, submit all your files for the assignment as usual.</p>

<h4>Changing an Extension</h4>
<p>If you submit an extension.txt before the deadline and then decide you do not need it, just turn your code as usual and include an extension.txt file without any text. If you realize that you need even more time, you may grant yourself an additional extension following the same procedure again. However, repeated resets are unlikely to enhance your learning, so be mindful about how much time you add to your clock!</p>


<h3>Revise and Resubmit</h3>
<p>In order to improve your learning and reduce grade anxiety, you may revise and resubmit homework assignments in this class. The rules for revising and resubmitting assignments are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may not resubmit an assignment on which you received a 0.</li>
  <li>Your resubmission must include a changelog explaining or showing what changed from the first submission.</li>
  <li>Revise and resubmits are unlimited.</li>
  <li>The highest grade will prevail (even if it was not the most recent submission).</li>
</ul>

<strong>Resubmissions missing a changelog or tracked changes will not be regraded</strong>. 

<h3>Final Grades</h3>
<p>Your grade will be a weighted average of all assignments, as shown below.</p> 

<div class="w3-row">
  <div class="w3-third">
    <h5>Assignment Weights</h5>
    <img src="assets/grades.png" style="max-width: 550px;">
  </div>
</div>

<p>We will round decimals to the nearest whole number and assign letter grades as follows:</p>

<div class="w3-row">
  <div class="w3-half"><img src="assets/number_grades.png" style="width: 100%; max-width:550px;"></div>      
</div>

<h3>Classroom Conduct</h3>
<p>All students and teaching staff are expected to treat each other with kindness and consideration. Equity and inclusivity are priorities in this class, and centering those systematically marginalized in higher ed and STEM will be a priority. If you have any requests or feedback, please reach out to Ab.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on assignments. The following information is required for all submitted work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the submission. If you worked alone, please state: "I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment."</li>
    <li>A "References" section, with in-line citations to any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment."</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>You may consult online resources as part of your coursework, but you may not directly copy thoughts or code from online sources.</p>

<p>ChatGPT may not be used to perform the intellectual tasks required to complete an assignment. In other words, your writing and code must be your own, not generated by ChatGPT (this includes modifying code or text generated by ChatGPT - doing so is a violation of academic integrity for this course).</p>

<p>If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, please ask!</p>
<p>You can find the colleges's academic integrity policy here: <a href="https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0" target="_blank">https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0</a>.</p> 

<h3>Accessibility and Accomodations</h3>
<p>Students with disabilities who wish to receive academic services and/or accommodations should contact <a href="https://www.smith.edu/your-campus/offices-services/accessibility-resource-center/request-accommodations" target="_blank">Disability Services Offices</a>. If you have already done so, please provide your letter for accommodations to Ab early in the semester so they can arrange those accommodations.</p>

<h3>Comfy Class Policy</h3>
<p>Everyone is welcome to make themselves comfortable in our classroom and asked to be respectful of one another. When you are communicating, please practice active listening by focusing on understanding what others are expressing rather than thinking of how you will respond. Additionally, keep in mind that our wide array of individual backgrounds shape our unique perspectives, so please respect one another when we have sincere differences of opinion.</p>

<p>You may bring beverages or snacks, but please use closed containers to avoid spills and keep messy foods away from computers. Everyone is free to use concentration accommodations like fidget toys, knitting, doodling, moving around, or sitting on the floor; just be mindful your focus does not disrupt others. Parents and caregivers may bring their babies and children to class whenever necessary. Learners of all stages are invited to join us.</p>

<h3>A note to all students</h3>
<p>I (Ab) am here to support you. If at any point in the semester you realize there is something I could do to better support you, please reach out. This can be something as small as letting me know I am not making the font big enough on my presentations, to sharing that you need some help getting caught up after a hard day or week.</p>
<p>Please be respectful of your classmates and instructor's wellbeing. <b class="w3-text-red">You should not come to class if you are not feeling well.</b> This includes COVID symptoms, and symptoms of non-COVID illnesses. If you need to miss class, I will work with you to stay caught up.</p>
