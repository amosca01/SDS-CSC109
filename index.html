<h2>Course Overview and Policies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The world is growing increasingly reliant on collecting and analyzing information to help people make decisions. Because of this, the ability to communicate effectively about data is an important component of future job prospects across nearly all disciplines. In this course, students learn the foundations of information visualization and sharpen their skills in communicating using data. This course explores concepts in decision-making, human perception, color theory and storytelling as they apply to data-driven communication. This course helps students build a strong foundation in how to talk to people about data, for both aspiring data scientists and students who want to learn new ways of presenting information.</p> 

<p>No prior programming experience is required for this class.</p>

<h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
By the end of this course students will be able to:

<ul> 
  <li>Map data to appropriate visual channels</li>
  <li>Tell stories with data</li>
  <li>Employ user-centered design</li>
</ul>

<h3>Communication Expectations</h3>

<p>All written communication regarding this course will take place via Slack (a cloud-based communcation platform that supports text, voice, and video). This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>announcements (in the #general channel)</li>
  <li>questions about the material (in the #questions channel)</li>
  <li>messages between individual students and the instructor</li>
</ul>

<p>Email is hard to search, response rate is slow, and messages are likely to get lost. Use Slack!</p>

<p>Messages sent M-F between 9am and 5pm will get a response within 24hrs. Messages sent outside of this time frame will have a slower response rate.</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>

<p>There is no required textbook for this class.</p>

<p>If you would like textbooks to use as reference, here are some (imperfect) options:</p>
<ul>
   <li><em>Data Feminism (Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein), MIT Press, 2020</em></li>
   <li><em>Visualization Analysis and Design (Tamara Munzner), CRC Press, 2014</em></li>
   <li><em>Visual Thinking for Information Design (Colin Ware), Morgan Kaufmann, 2021</em></li>
   <li><em>Beautiful Visualization: Looking at Data Through the Eyes of Experts (Julie Steele and Noah Iliinsky), O'Reilly, 2010</em></li>
   <li><em>The Functional Art (Alberto Cairo), New Riders, 2012</em></li>
</ul>

<p>If purchasing causes financial strain please come see Ab so that we can make alternative arrangements.</p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>All assignments will be submitted through Gradescope: <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/824387" target="_blank">https://www.gradescope.com/courses/824387</a></p>
<p>Entry code: NYG3RZ</p>

<p>There are a variety of assignments in this class: Homeworks, Mid-Semester Project, Final Project, and Participation and Engagement. The purpose of this is provide as many ways as possible for students to demonstrate mastery of material.</p>

<h4>Homeworks</h4>  

<p>Homework is a chance to practice topics covered in lecture and receive feedback. See rubrics for grading guidelines. During the first half of the semester, the primary deliverables for this course will be weekly data challenges. A new dataset will be introduced during lecture, along with a set of guiding questions. Your task is to use what you know about data visualization and modeling to wrangle, explore, and ultimately report back your findings. Along the way, you'll document your analysis process, justify your visualization choices, and report any assumptions you make about the data.</p>

<h4>Mid-Semester Project</h4>  

<p>The mid-semester project is a chance for students to work together and explore the creative side of information visualization. The project will be completed in groups, and will culminate in a physical visualization to be shared with the Smith campus. Grading will consider individual contributions, group dynamics, technical details, and creativity.</p>  

<h4>Final Project</h4>

<p>Final projects present the opportunity for students to apply the visualization techniques covered in class to a topic of interest to them. This assignment will be completed in groups. Grading will look at technical details, and creativity.</p>

<h4>Participation and Engagement</h4>

<p>Participation and engagement will take into account contributions in class which demonstrate intellectual curiosity or clear understanding of a topic, comments which help others in class to learn a difficult concept, timeliness and proactive communication about class attendance, and lab submissions.</p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>
<p>All assignments are due as listed on the <a href="#schedule">Course Schedule</a>. There is a 24 hour gace period for late submissions, however you must be in class that day (or excused beforehand) and after the grace period <bold>late assignments will not be accepted</bold>.</p>

<p>If you have extenuating circumstances and need a more significant extension that is okay, however it is your responsibility to email Ab BEFORE the assignment is due to make arrangements.</p>


<h4>Revise and Resubmit</h4>
<p>There will be no regrades on assignments, or late submissions. However, if you are unhappy with a grade on an assignment you may revise and resubmit the assignment. The rules for resubmitting assignments are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may not resubmitt and assignment on which you received a 0.</li>
  <li>Your resubmission must note where changes were made and explain how the changes address the feedback you received on your first submission.</li>
  <li>Your resubmission must include a thoughtful paragraph explaining what you learned from re-doing your assignment and how you will incorporate those lessons into future assignments.</li>
  <li>You may only resubmit within 2 weeks of receiving a grade on an assignment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Grades</h3>
<p>Your grade will be a weighted average of all assignments, as shown below.</p>

<h3>Classroom Conduct</h3>
<p>All students and teaching staff are expected to treat each other with kindness and consideration. Equity and inclusivity are priorities in this class, and centering those systematically marginalized in higher ed and STEM will be a priority. If you have any requests or feedback, please reach out to Ab.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on assignments. The following information is required for all submitted work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the submission. If you worked alone, please state: "I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment."</li>
    <li>A "References" section, with in-line citations to any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment."</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>You may consult online resources as part of your coursework, but you may not directly copy thoughts or code from online sources.</p>

<p>ChatGPT may not be used to perform the intellectual tasks required to complete an assignment. In other words, your writing and code must be your own, not generated by ChatGPT.</p>

<p>If you have a question about what is considered a violation of this policy, please ask!</p>
<p>You can find the colleges's academic integrity policy here: <a href="https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0" target="_blank">https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook/academic-honor-code-0</a>.</p> 

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

If you have already done so, please provide your letter for accommodations to Ab early in the semester so they can arrange those accommodations.</p>

<h3>A note to all students</h3>
<p>I (Ab) am here to support you. If at any point in the semester you realize there is something I could do to better support you, please reach out. This can be something as small as letting me know I am not making the font big enough on my presentations, to sharing that you need some help getting caught up after a hard day or week.</p>
<p>Please be respectful of your classmates and instructor's wellbeing. <b class="w3-text-red">You should not come to class if you are not feeling well.</b> This includes COVID symptoms, and symptoms of non-COVID illnesses. If you need to miss class, I will work with you to stay caught up.</p>
